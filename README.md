# ecoAI: GenAI-Powered Climate Action Advisor

## Description
ecoAI is an interactive web platform designed for the FutureStack GenAI hackathon (Sept 29 - Oct 5, 2025), empowering users to reduce their carbon footprint through personalized, AI-driven insights. Users input daily habits (e.g., energy use, travel, diet) to receive a detailed carbon footprint analysis, tailored sustainability plans, and real-time "what-if" simulations for greener choices. Built with **Next.js** (frontend), **Node.js/Express** (backend), **Meta's Llama 3.1** (for NLP and plan generation), **Cerebras** (for ultra-fast inference and simulations), and **Docker** (for scalable deployment), ecoAI combines cutting-edge AI with a polished UX to make climate action accessible and actionable. Think of it as a sustainability coach that leverages the world's fastest AI chips and open-source LLMs to drive real-world impact.

## Unique Features
ecoAI stands out by blending sponsor technologies with innovative features, addressing hackathon judging criteria: potential impact, creativity, technical implementation, learning, aesthetics/UX, and presentation.

- **Personalized Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Analyzes user inputs (e.g., 600kWh electricity, 200 miles driven) using Llama's NLP, pulling from embedded climate datasets (IPCC, EPA) for accurate emissions estimates.
- **AI-Generated Sustainability Plans**: Llama crafts narrative plans (e.g., "Switch to LEDs: Save 0.5 tons CO2/year") with actionable steps, visualized via Recharts for user-friendly insights.
- **Real-Time Scenario Simulations**: Cerebras accelerates complex "what-if" simulations (e.g., "If I go electric, save 1.5 tons CO2") using Monte Carlo methods, delivering results in seconds.
- **RAG-Enhanced Knowledge Base**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS vector DB ensures cited, trustworthy advice from vetted sources, uniquely combining Node.js and Python workflows.
- **Interactive Dashboard UX**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS and Recharts delivers responsive forms, charts, and chat-like interfaces for iterative queries, scoring high on aesthetics.
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: Supports team profiles (e.g., households) for shared plans, with Docker ensuring isolated, scalable sessions.
- **Ethical AI Safeguards**: Bias-checked Llama prompts and transparent data sourcing boost learning and trust.
- **Offline-Capable Deployment**: Docker containers enable local runs, ideal for low-connectivity areas, with Cerebras cloud for heavy computations.
- **Export & Sharing**: Generate PDF reports or shareable links with embedded sim results, enhancing presentation for judges.
- **Sponsor Synergy**: Deep integration of Llama (reasoning), Cerebras (speed), and Docker (deployment) maximizes technical and creativity scores.

## Data Flow
ecoAI's architecture is modular, ensuring low latency and scalability. Here's how data flows through the system:

1. **User Input**: Next.js frontend submits JSON (e.g., `{energy: 600kWh, travel: 200miles}`) via POST to `/analyze` endpoint on Node/Express backend.
2. **Backend Orchestration**: Express validates input and forwards it to the Python AI microservice (Dockerized) using Axios.
3. **AI Processing**:
   - Embeds input with Hugging Face BGE embeddings.
   - RAG retrieves relevant climate docs from FAISS vector DB.
   - Llama generates sustainability plans; Cerebras accelerates inference and simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo for EV scenarios).
   - Returns JSON: `{footprint, plan, sims}`.
4. **Response Rendering**: Express formats response (adds chart data), sends to Next.js for rendering as interactive dashboards with Recharts.
5. **Caching/Storage**: Redis (optional) caches results; SQLite stores user profiles for collaboration.

**Diagram**:
```
User (Next.js) --> POST /analyze --> Node/Express
                  |
                  v
HTTP --> Python AI Service (Docker)
         - Embed (BGE)
         - RAG (FAISS)
         - Generate (Llama)
         - Simulate (Cerebras)
         |
         v
JSON <-- Express --> Next.js (Charts, Plans)
```

## Working Model with Example
ecoAI operates as an agentic workflow: Input → RAG → Generation → Simulation → Output. Here's an example:

**Input**: User submits via Next.js form: "Family of 4 in NYC, 600kWh electricity/month, drive 200 miles/week, eat meat daily."

1. **Parsing**: Express routes input to Python AI service.
2. **RAG Retrieval**: Embeds query, retrieves docs (e.g., "NYC emissions: 0.5kg CO2/kWh" from IPCC).
3. **Footprint Calculation**: Llama calculates: 3.2 tons CO2/year (Energy 40%, Travel 35%, Food 25%).
4. **Plan Generation**: Llama outputs: "Reduce meat to 3x/week: Save 0.8 tons. Install solar: Offset 1.2 tons."
5. **Simulation**: Cerebras runs fast sim: "Switch to EV: -1.5 tons, total 1.7 tons/year."
6. **Output**: Next.js renders dashboard with pie chart, plan list, and interactive sim sliders.

**Sample Output**:
- **Footprint**: 3.2 tons CO2/year (visualized as pie chart).
- **Plan**: 1. Go vegetarian 3x/week. 2. Use public transit. 3. Link to energy audit app.
- **Sim**: "EV switch → 1.7 tons (save $500/year)."

Users can iterate via chat-like UI, with Cerebras ensuring <2s responses.

## Real-World Examples
ecoAI draws inspiration from production-grade tools, enhanced for hackathon innovation:
